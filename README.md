### PyCon 2022 - Smart Data Visualization Workshop

#### Abstract:

Health data is bundled with a wealth of information. Mining interpretable and correct insights from medical data is exacting. However, the choice of visualisation tools holds the power of unraveling intuition relatively quickly and with simplicity. This workshop introduces beginners as well as intermediate python users on wisely using the right plots and graphs to intelligently discern the rich information hidden in healthcare data. In this workshop, we will use the COVID-19 real world datasets scraped from JHU CSSE and worldometer. We wil demonstrate hands-on on how to build interesting visualizations using matplotlib and plotly libraries in Python during the course of the workshop.

#### Description:

This workshop is for Python beginners and intermediate learners.

We assume you have a laptop and basic understanding of Python language and libraries. Even if you don’t have any prior experience with Python, don’t worry, we will cover them for you in the workshop.

During this workshop, we will together build smart visualisations using a combination of data visualisation python libraries (matplotlib, plotly) using COVID-19 open source dataset (https://github.com/imdevskp/covid_19_jhu_data_web_scrap_and_cleaning ).

We will cover the following graphs under visualisation:

- 2-d bar charts
- 2-d line charts
- 2-d tree maps
- 2-d region graphs
- 3-d Scatter Plot
- 3-d Area graph
